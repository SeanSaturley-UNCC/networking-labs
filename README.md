# Cisco Packet Tracer Networking Labs

## Overview
This repository contains networking labs I completed using Cisco Packet Tracer.  
The labs focus on core networking skills for junior network and systems roles, like VLANs, routing, and access control.  

These exercises helped me practice hands-on configuration, troubleshooting, and verifying network setups in a simulated environment.

## Tools & Technologies
- Cisco Packet Tracer  
- Cisco IOS (CLI)  
- VLANs (802.1Q)  
- Router-on-a-Stick (Inter-VLAN Routing)  
- Static Routing  
- Access Control Lists (ACLs)  
- IPv4 Addressing & Subnetting  

---

## Labs Included

### VLAN Practice
- Created VLANs on a switch and assigned ports  
- Verified VLANs using `show vlan brief`  
- Tested communication within VLANs  

### Inter-VLAN Routing
- Configured a router-on-a-stick setup with subinterfaces  
- Set up 802.1Q trunking between switch and router  
- Assigned IP gateways for each VLAN  
- Verified connectivity between VLANs using `ping`  

### Static Routing Practice
- Configured routers with static routes to connect different networks  
- Verified routing tables with `show ip route`  
- Tested end-to-end connectivity between hosts  

### Access Control Lists (ACLs)
- Applied standard ACLs to control network traffic  
- Restricted access between certain networks  
- Tested ACLs using `ping` and connectivity checks

## Skills Practiced
- VLAN configuration and network segmentation  
- Inter-VLAN routing  
- Static routing fundamentals  
- Basic ACL implementation  
- Troubleshooting connectivity issues  
- Working with Cisco IOS CLI
